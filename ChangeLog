Version 4.4.0 (molinaro)
  * change to allow emitting of iolists
  * function added to allow easy appending of headers to event
  * fixes for validation

Version 4.3.0 (molinaro)
  * Support added for esf based validation

Version 4.2.1 (twhalen)
  * Fixed lwes:emit bug with lists of events

Version 4.2.0 (molinaro)
  * attempt to use SO_REUSEPORT if available
  * remove use of erlang:now() from lwes_journaller

Version 4.1.0 (molinaro)
  * recbuf now configurable (and defaults to the larger size)
  * start at a journal_listener

Version 4.0.0 (molinaro)
  * improved code coverage significantly, which fixed some issues?
    * various json formats were structured poorly
  * if incoming packet already has ReceiptTime, SenderIP and SenderPort
  at the end of the event, don't add them (to keep proxied events honest).
  This breaks backward compatibility in case someone was relying on the
  previous behavior which was that fields showed up twice.

Version 3.1.0 (molinaro)
  * set default TTL for multicast to 5, also allow it to be overridden

Version 3.0.1 (molinaro)
  * fix eunit test from old refactor

Version 3.0.0 (molinaro)
  * allow for easy re-emission of events without deserializing
  * prevent some malformed events (breaks backward compatibility for users of
    lwes_event:peek_name_from_udp/1)

Version 2.4.0 (vikramkadi)
  * New type long_string added to support strings bigger than
  * 65kb 

Version 2.3.1 (molinaro)
  * there was an encoding bug with string types

Version 2.3.0 (molinaro)
  * added array types

Version 2.2.0 (molinaro)
  * lwes_multi_emitter now supports randomly selecting groups to send to
  * lwes_multi_emitter now supports groups (so nesting)
  * send and receive stats are not collected and viewable

Version 2.1.2 (molinaro)
  * hopefully last change, eep18 format should return a top-level tuple

Version 2.1.1 (molinaro)
  * did the last version too fast missed some cases where json was used

Version 2.1.0 (molinaro)
  * proplists was actually wrong as ejson requires eep18 and as that my
    primary usecase for the json output, there are now 3 json decode formats
    json will return mochijson2 struct format, json_proplist will return
    the mochijson2 proplist formant, and json_eep18 will return the mochijson2
    eep18 format

Version 2.0.0 (molinaro)
  * switch to decoding as proplists, instead of struct's
  * moved some files from mochiweb into lwes, so I could skip the dependency
  * don't check return code of send so that it doesn't crash lwes if the
  network is down

Version 1.0.3 (molinaro)
  * missing dependency

Version 1.0.2 (molinaro)
  * need to increase recbuf size in order to journal everything

Version 1.0.1 (molinaro)
  * zero length strings should be allowed
  * for 'json' format, use mochijson2:decode for values

Version 1.0.0 (molinaro)
  * changed lwes:open to take different number of args, breaks backward
  compatibility
  * add 'dict' as a format for event attributes in deserialization
  * added journaller
  * added multi emitter
  * added 'json' as a format for event deserialization

Version 0.0.0 (molinaro)
  * Initial version
